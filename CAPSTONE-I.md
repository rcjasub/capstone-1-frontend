# ðŸ“Š Capstone I: Working Together

## Working with TAs

Each group will have a TA assigned as your primary contact. Your assigned TA will meet with you daily, shortly after lunch. Keep them informed about how your project is going, what problems you're facing, and wins worth celebrating! Your assigned TA is not the only person you can reach out to for help, but they should be the first point of contact.

## Pre-Coding Checklist

You are NOT permitted to start writing code until the following tasks have been accomplished and verified by someone from the Instructional Team. Feel free to spend all day Thursday and Friday on these tasks. Preparation is important! You'll be given a pair of starting point repos once you're cleared for takeoff.

1. Confirm that you are able to access the **cohort Discord** on campus WiFi (try https://ptb.discord.com/).
2. You've created a **GitHub Project Board** populated with issues to get started on the project.
3. You have a **database schema diagram** (we recommend https://dbdiagram.io).
4. You have a **UI diagram on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)**. You don't need to have created all the UI views just yet, but at least one for now.
5. You have a **Team Norms Google Document** ([template here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kKkbEWmXAA6VJK5ZPmkyeqgySchUwpPvuWMVLuiYeSs/edit?usp=sharing)). You should have discussed questions such as: how do we review Pull Requests before they're merged?

## Getting Started

Once you've passed the Pre-Coding Checklist and you've been given the starting point repos, you'll want to do these things right away:

1. Make sure everyone is a collaborator, able to push commits to the team repo.
2. Make sure everyone is able to run the project locally. No exceptions! If anyone on the team isn't able to run the project on their machines, fixing that is _everyone's_ top priority.
3. Deploy the application on Vercel. It'll be easier to deploy the starting point repos before you've added a lot of changes.

## A Few Final Notes

You may be tempted to focus on a particular part of the stack that you're most comfortable with. Don't! Everyone should have experience working with every part of the stack. In fact, you may find it easier to work on features "vertically" â€“ build the necesssary backend and frontend functionality as part of the same PR.

This project will require research and reading documentation. This is real work, and deserves time and recognition. Consider how you want to handle research tasks on the team.

Keep in mind: the primary learning objective here is collaboration. Pay close attention to team communication habits. Reflect on the highs and the lows. When something doesn't seem to be working well, consider how best to bring it up in a constructive way. Emotional intelligence and social awareness are surprisingly important skills for software engineering.
