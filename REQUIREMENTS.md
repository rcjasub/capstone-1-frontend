# üó≥Ô∏è Capstone I: Project Requirements

## Learning Goals

This project is designed to reinforce fullstack web development concepts we've learned so far, including React, React-Router, Network Requests, Express, Sequelize / PostgreSQL, Deployment, Authentication / Authorization, and more.

You will also be working with a team over several weeks. This project is more ambitious than the CRUD app you built earlier, meaning you'll have to spend more time discussing the architecture of your application and how to prioritize and assign tasks. Collaboration is the _primary learning obective_ of this project.

## Overview

You'll be building a ranked choice poll app. Our market research tells us that users frequently want to poll their coworkers or friend groups to compare different options (e.g. where should we get catering from for our company retreat?). Simply asking people "what option do you like best?" doesn't actually capture their true preferences. Instead, we want users to be able to rank the available options, and a winner will be decided accordingly. Applications like Poll Everywhere, Typeform, and Google Forms are popular, but don't currently meet this need.

Users should be able to create a poll, listing several options. Once they're satisfied, they can "publish" the poll, generating a link. Once published, the poll can no longer be modified. They can share the link and respondents can rank their options from first to last, according to their preferences. When the poll is closed, the results are tallied and displayed in a nice-looking bar chart.
